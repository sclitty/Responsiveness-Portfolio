    Notes
        - used page layout as background-img since it looked fitting as a learning web developer
        - renamed "< container >" div to a standard "< div >" was causing issues with css
        probably a better semantic tag but div works well. 
   
    Portfolio Page 
        -added media query to prevent img overlap on smaller screens
